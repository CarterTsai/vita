Usage:
  vita [OPTIONS]

  -h, --help
                             Print usage information and exit.
  -H, --config-help
                             Print configuration help and exit.
  -n, --name <id>
                             Claim <id> for this Vita node.
  -c, --cpu <cpus>
                             Bind Vita processes to <cpus>. Must be a
                             comma-separated list of CPU identifiers.
  -b, --busywait
                             Run in busy-wait loop, trading CPU cycles for
                             latency.
  -r, --realtime
                             Use real-time scheduling.

Run Vita, configurable via `snabb config'. Refer to “--config-help” for a
description of the documentation schema.

Note that Vita needs super-user privileges to run as it needs unrestricted
access to hardware devices via DMA and system resources like hugepages. Vita
also requires a CPU that support AES-NI and AVX-2. It is also required to boot
Linux with the kernel parameter iommu=off for Snabb device drivers to function.

Vita will fork into five processes which individually handle key management,
outbound routing, inbound routing, encapsulation, and decapsulation. The
resulting processes can be bound to specific CPUs using the “--cpu” option in
the given order.

Example:
  vita --name my-vita --cpus 0,1,2,3,4
