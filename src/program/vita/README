Usage:
  vita [OPTIONS] <confpath>

  -h, --help
                             Print usage information and exit.
  -H, --config-help
                             Print configuration help and exit.
  -t  --config-test
                             Validate configuration and exit.
  -c, --cpu <cpus>
                             Bind Vita processes to <cpus>. Must be a
                             comma-separated list of CPU identifiers.

Run Vita configured by <confpath>. While running, Vita will continuously reload
and apply the configuration file at <confpath> whenever it changes, thus you
can reconfigure Vita on-the-fly without restarting the process.

Note that Vita needs super-user privileges to run as it needs unrestricted
access to hardware devices via DMA and system resources like hugepages. Vita
also requires a CPU that support AES-NI and AVX-2. It is also required to boot
Linux with the kernel parameter iommu=off for Snabb device drivers to function.

Refer to “--config-help” on how to configure Vita. New configurations can be
validated before applying with “--config-test”. Don’t worry: invalid
configurations will not bring down a running Vita instance, but merely fail to
be loaded.

Vita will fork into five processes which individually handle key management,
outbound routing, inbound routing, encapsulation, and decapsulation. The
resulting processes can be bound to specific CPUs using the “--cpu” option in
the given order.

Example:
  vita --cpus 0,1,2,3,4 /etc/vita.conf
  vita --config-test new.conf && mv new.conf /etc/vita.conf
