  -c, --cpu <cpus>
                             Bind Vita processes to <cpus>. Must be a
                             comma-separated list of CPU identifiers.

Run Vita configured by <confpath>. Vita will fork into four processes which
individually handle private port routing, public port routing, encryption, and
decryption.

The resulting processes can be bound to specific CPUs using the “--cpu” option
in the given order. The processes are as follows: key manager, outbound router,
inbound router, encapsulaton worker, decapsulation worker.

Example:
  vita --cpus 0,1,2,3,4 /etc/vita.conf
